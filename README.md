# Advent of Code 2025
This time I'm working on a rust-webassembly application which will run in the browser.

To set up:
 - install rust and npm
 - run `npm install`
 - run `npm run serve`. This will install and build the webassembly output using rust, and then serve a simple website at localhost:8080
